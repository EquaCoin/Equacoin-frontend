# Equacoin-frontend
EquaCoin is a crypto currency that is designed to support democratic principles. The self-explaining name comes from the synthesis of ‘Equality’ and ‘Coin’.

Our Mission is to build and constantly improve an innovative monetary instrument that will allow each person who owns at least one EquaCoin, to vote and participate in a Democratic Marketplace. EquaCoin will distribute a free wallet with one coin in it, to most of the European population (then distribution will be done to the rest of the world) through some online and offline marketing campaigns.

In particular we focus on the monetary policy of currency creation and its distribution. We are building our wallet also with the possibility for users to post a project and vote for others. “One head, one vote” Changing the world one EquaCoin at a time - Together we can do what no one of us can do alone. Equacoin will finance project that will be chosed and voted online.

Regardless if people would have millions of coins or just one, they will have equal voting power.

A first version of wallet, with limited functionalities, will be available online before November 30, 2017. In the coming weeks, some new technologies will be implemented with an upgrade of the wallet, including biometric security authentication.
